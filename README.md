# CNN
1. Use CNN to classify cat and dog /n
Import the required libraries, such as TensorFlow, for implementing CNN models in Python.
Load the dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately formatted and split into training, validation, and testing sets.
Preprocess the images by resizing them to a consistent size and normalizing the pixel values to a suitable range.
Divide the dataset into training validation and testing sets, maintaining a balanced distribution of cat and dog images in each set.
Define a CNN model architecture using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Compile the model by specifying an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification), optimizer ( RMSprop), and evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy).

2. Use CNN to predict the financial stock market (Nasdaq) :
Import the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow, for implementing CNN models in Python.
Load the financial stock market data for Nasdaq, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.
Describe the data by examining its statistical properties, identifying any missing values, outliers, or trends, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of its characteristics.
Divide the database into weekly and monthly intervals, aggregating the relevant data points (e.g., closing prices) for each period.
Plot the data by date, visualizing the weekly and monthly trends using line plots or candlestick charts to gain insights into the stock market's historical performance.
Save the generated images in a specific path or format for future reference or reporting purposes.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that the temporal order is maintained to reflect real-world scenarios.
Load the images from the specific path and preprocess them if necessary (e.g., resizing, normalization).
Define a CNN model architecture suitable for time series analysis, incorporating convolutional layers, and pooling layers,...
